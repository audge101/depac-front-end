# DEPAC 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About This App

This app is an interactive and collaborative database for poisonous and medicinal plants, their uses by humans, and cultural importance.

### Our Users

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### User Stories

User goes to landing page and sees numerous database contributions (ie posts) by contributors (ie users) as well as a link to register or login. On the landing page there is a friendly reminder that in order to search our database users must register and login. Once the users does both they see a search bar at the top of the page and they search a plant or browse. On plant "contributions" are likes and comments. Contributors can be any user that makes a contribution to the database or likes or comments on any post in the database. Someone that creates a plant entry to the database can edit or delete their post. Users that are signed in can read or view individual posts. 

### Wireframes

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### Approach

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
